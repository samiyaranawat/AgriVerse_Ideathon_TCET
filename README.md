## 🚩 Problem Statement

Agriculture today operates in high-risk, low-margin conditions. Farmers struggle with degraded soil, inefficient water use, and crop losses from late disease detection. Lack of real-time intelligence, fragmented infrastructure, and limited access to advanced tools create inefficiencies that scale globally, threatening food security and sustainable growth.

## 🌍 Vision

AgriVerse envisions a future where soil, water, and crop management are seamlessly powered by intelligent technologies. By combining IoT infrastructure, AI/ML-driven analytics, and infrared-based sensing, we aim to build a scalable, globally connected ecosystem that enhances productivity, reduces risks, and strengthens sustainable agriculture for future generations.
